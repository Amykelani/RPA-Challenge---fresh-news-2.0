Robotics Process Automation (RPA) challenge to automate the process of extracting data from a news site.

These are the steps for running the application code on your local machine:

1. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Make sure you have the Chrome WebDriver installed and available in your PATH.
3. Create a Python script main.py.
4. Navigate to the root directory path using cd directory name to run the Python script main.py. This will initiate the scraping process, and if successful, it will save the scraped data into an Excel file named news_data.xlsx in the current directory.
5. To run the unit test, execute python unit_test.py. This test will instantiate the NewsScraper class, attempt to scrape news based on the provided parameters, and assert that the scraping process was successful.
